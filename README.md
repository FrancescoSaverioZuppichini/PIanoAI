# piano
An AI that fills empty space with its own improvisation it learns in realtime from your playing :piano:

## TODO

- [ ] [External script that will start/stop piano based on plugging in Midi](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/19600/is-there-a-way-to-automatically-activate-a-script-when-a-usb-device-connects?newreg=270fe49c413340daa171e1dfdbf96de9)
- [ ] Allow threshold for using notes for AI. (i.e. AI only generates licks on above middle C, or similar)
- [ ] Implement minimum distance between notes in AI so that more starts/stops are available.
- [ ] Put links to code on Youtube videos (link to tree)
