# piano
An AI that fills empty space with its own improvisation it learns in realtime from your playing :piano:

## ToDo

- [ ] [External script that will start/stop piano based on plugging in Midi](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/19600/is-there-a-way-to-automatically-activate-a-script-when-a-usb-device-connects?newreg=270fe49c413340daa171e1dfdbf96de9)
- [ ] Convert all the float64 (Start/End) to int. Just use int for tick and consider a "beat" to be tick/64 (discard remainder)
- [ ] Metacoupling: https://play.golang.org/p/Dgjx-zrGyM
